# Manhole_Monitoring_System

A smart city is the future objective to have cleaner and better conveniences for the general public. Smart underground foundation is a significant component to be considered while carrying out a brilliant city. Sewerage systems are an integral part of cities, causing stagnation of stormwater and grey water from households and industries. To avoid large-scale disruption, it is important to have a monitoring system in place and plan ahead to expand your waste water management system. Drainage system monitoring plays an essential job in keeping the city perfect and healthy.Since manual observing is awkward, this prompts slow treatment of issues in waste and consumes additional opportunity to address.To mitigate all these issues the framework utilizing a remote sensor organization, comprising sensor hubs is planned. The sewer condition serves as an input from the sensor and an alert reaches the monitoring system. Various test installations of the proposed system have shown that real-time monitoring helps monitor live conditions and prevent clogging of sewers with solid waste.The proposed framework is low cost, low support, IoT based genuine time which cautions the overseeing station through message when any manhole crosses its boundary values or threshold values.This system reduces the death risk of manual scavengers who clean the underground drainage and furthermore helps people in general.
